 ERR_PNPM_ADDING_TO_ROOT  Running this command will add the dependency to the workspace root, which might not be what you want - if you really meant it, make it explicit by running this command again with the -w flag (or --workspace-root). If you don't want to see this warning anymore, you may set the ignore-workspace-root-check setting to true.
